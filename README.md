This youtube clone contains a header section , a sidebar section and the video section.

You can login with your google account for which I have used google authentication using firebase. Then you can view the top 20 trending videos. You can search a channel and the channel videos will be displayed. You can subscribe to the channel , you can comment on a video. All these activities will take place on the real youtube page also. For this I have used the youtube API itself. To run this simply run 'npm install' and then run 'npm start' to start the server.
